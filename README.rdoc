= com.depold.helpers.MapBuilder

This helper offers a "simple" way to create HashMaps in Java.
To do so, just use the following syntax:

	Map map = MapBuilder.build(new Object[] {
		"key1", 123,
		"key2", 345,
		"key3", 456
	});
	
It's important, that the passed array has an even length. Otherwise you will get an exception.
